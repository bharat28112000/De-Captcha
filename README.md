## DeCaptcha - recognizing CAPTCHA characters using image pre-processing & ML

    1. Devised a robust solution for recognizing CAPTCHA characters by applying image pre-processing techniques to extract characters from complex backgrounds. 
       Employed segmentation to isolate individual characters.
    2. Explored three distinct approaches, namely SVM, CNN, and Logistic Regression, for character recognition. 
       Through a comprehensive evaluation process, identified Logistic Regression as the optimal choice, yielding an impressive accuracy rate of 98.5\% on the recognition task.
    3. Delivered precise results with compact 174KB model and quick prediction time of 4 ms.
